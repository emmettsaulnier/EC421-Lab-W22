# Introduction  

This repository has the material we will be covering in the lab section of EC 421 for winter term 2022.

Lab sections will be held weekly in McKenzie 442 on Mondays and Tuesdays from 4:00pm to 5:20pm.  

The Monday lab will be recorded and subsequently posted to the class Canvas page for those who wish to watch asynchronously.
